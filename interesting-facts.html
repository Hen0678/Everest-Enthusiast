                <h3>1. It's many names</h3>
                <br>
                <p>To most the mountain is known as Mount Everest. However, it's important to remember that the
                    mountain
                    was known to the local people long before the first Western eyes set sight on it.
                    The Tibetan name, Chomolungma, means “Goddess Mother of the World”. The Nepalase people refer to
                    the
                    mountain as Sagarmatha, the “Peak of Heaven"
                    When the mountain was surveyed it was original called Peak XV, before being renamed for Sir
                    George
                    Everest, the surveyor-general of India from 1830 to 1843.

                <br>
                <h3>2. The first successful summit</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Officialy the first successful summit of Mount Everest was by Sir Edmund Hilary and his Sherpa
                    Tenzing Norgay in 1953. However, in 1924 George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a summit attempt
                    and
                    were last seen just below the summit. This was the last anyone saw of Mallory until 1999 when
                    his
                    body was found on the mountain. Whether Mallory or Irvine ever got to the top will likely remain
                    unknown.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>3. The first woman to summit Everest</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In 1975, Japanese climber Junko Tabei became the first woman to summit Mount Everest. As just
                    the
                    36th person ever to climb the mountain, Tabei’s incredible achievement made her a global
                    celebrity
                    and assured her a place in the history books.

                <br>
                <h3>4. An ever growing graveyard</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    When people die climbing Everest, their bodies are left on the mountain and become landmarks for
                    other mountaineers. It’s almost impossible to bury a body on Mount Everest due to the ice-hard
                    ground. And it is as great a challenge for anyone to carry/drag the dead bodies due to the physical
                    effort needed in the low-oxygen environment.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>5. It's becoming a busy place</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Mount Everest has been summitted over 9000 times. The best time to climb Everest is Mid March to mid
                    June. This small window of opportunity, coupled with the accessibility to the mountian and the
                    numerous expidition operators means that Everest has become a busy place. This can result in long
                    queues (and wait times) to reach the summit.
