## Features

### Navigation bar

This features links to the three pages of the site, namely:
1. Home
2. Interesting Facts
3. Sign Up 

The navigation bar is responsive, so as the screen size gets smaller the links change to a burger dropdown icon. The format and layout is the same across all three pages which creates a consistent look and feel for the user.
