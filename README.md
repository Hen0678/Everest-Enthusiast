# Everest Enthusiast
## Overview
Everest Enthusiast is a website for those fascinated with the highest mountain on earth - Mount Everest and who want to learn more. For decades this mountain nestled in the Himalayas in the remote country of Nepal has caputured the imagination of mankind. Even today, with the advent of modern day travel the mountain still holds an air of mystery. 

As the website grows new content will be added, including more interesting facts, high quality images and a detailed timeline of key events. There will also be video content added which will capture iconic areas of the mountain, such as the various base camps, the Hilary step and the summit itself. For those who aspire to one day climb the mountain, or simply basecamp there will be a section dedicated to the type of kit required.

## Features

### Header and navigation bar
This features links to the three pages of the site, namely:
1. Home
2. Interesting Facts
3. Sign Up 

The navigation bar is responsive, so as the screen size gets smaller the links change to a burger dropdown icon. The format and layout is the same across all three pages which creates a consistent look and feel for the user.

The colour used for the navigation is "whitesmoke" which is fitting with the image of Mount Everest which has swirling white cloud around the peak.

The same header is used on each page of the website.

### Home page
#### Top section
The home page has an awe inspiring image of the top of Mount Everest with the cloud swirling around the peak. The image is overlaid with text proclaiming the top of the mountain as the roof of the world.

All fields require completing and the Email address field will look for an @ to be included.
